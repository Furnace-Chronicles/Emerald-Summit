# Any changes you've made.  See valid prefix list above.

# SCREW THIS UP AND IT WON'T WORK.
# Also, this gets changed to [] after reading.  Just remove the brackets when you add new shit.
# Please surround your changes in  double quotes ("). It works without them, but if you use certain characters it screws up compiling. The quotes will not show up in the changelog.
changes:
  - rscadd: "Werewolves can now remain in wolf form if they hide underground during daylight. This feature is designed to encourage establishing underground 'wolf dens' to hide and socialise in"
  - rscadd: "Added a new werewolf spell, Den Sense, it examines the surrounding area for its suitability as a wolf den, to help you find hidey holes."
  - balance: "Werewolves in wolf form will now revert in daytime, not at dawn, when they are exposed to sunlight. The dawn period is intended to act as a warning, to run for your den before the sun is fully up"
  - balance: "Werewolf stat bonus now only applies fully during the night period. It is reduced during dawn, day, and dusk, (and reverts to full at night)"
  - admin: "Fixed a bug in the admin command to set time of day, that would make it frozen forever with no way to resume. It can now be resumed"
  - admin: "Renamed the above command , 'Time of Day: Override' and moved it to the gamemaster menu"
  - admin: "Added a new gamemaster command, 'Time of Day: Advance', this command sets the time of day and does not freeze it, allowing time to continue normally from the start of the specified time period."
